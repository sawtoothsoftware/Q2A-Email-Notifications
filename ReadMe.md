#Q2A Email Notifications Revised

This plugin allows you to create a page where people can register to
receive notifications about new questions and answers.  It also allows
you to specify that Experts, Editors, and Moderators will also receive
notifications like Admins do.

The user notification list can grow to the point that it becomes very
slow to post new questions and answers.  To correct this problem, I
have included some custom code in the qa-external to modify the
external mailer to accept BCC.  I included code for a newer version of
PHPMailer because we had problems connecting to GMail with the default
code.  If you use the user notifications, it is recommended that you
use this external mailer code or modify it for your particular
situation.

Only logged in users can subscribe, since we use the userid as a key
instead of the email.

This plugin was inspired and based on https://github.com/sawtoothsoftware/Q2A-Email-Notifications 

A less intrusive (does not create a new table in the database plugin
with the ability to send notifications only for favorited categories
can also be found at https://github.com/dunse/qa-category-email-notifications
